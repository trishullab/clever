function_signature: "def find_zero(xs: list)"
docstring: |
    xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees a solution.
    Note(): This problem has been modified from the original HumanEval spec because of Real is not a computable type, but a zero does not necessarily exist over the rationals.
test_cases:
  - input: [1, 2]
    output: -0.5
  - input: [-6, 11, -6, 1]
    output: 1.0

-- Note: The above implementation can fail to converge in some cases. For example,
-- on the test case [-6, 11, -6, 1] as the derivative of the polynomial
-- can be zero at if the guess is 0. In such cases, the implementation will not
-- converge. The implementation can be improved by using a better guess.
